      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Evren, a physics student at the University of Ottawa with a passion for exploring the universe through science and technology. My curiosity fuels my drive to solve challenging problems, and my interests are primarily in cutting edge technology. I enjoy being at the intersection of innovation and discovery, where physics is.
        When I'm not immersed in my studies, I practice Muay Thai and enjoy working on projects that excite me. My goal is to work on groundbreaking advancements in technology and research that shape our future. I have previously created a home server, from which I hosted video game servers such as a modded Minecraft server, as well as my home media server. I have also jailbroken my PS4, installed Linux and ran video game emulators on the Linux OS. And of course, I created this website!
        I am an active learner and enjoy working on new projects all the time! I am currently using PyTorch to learn how to create neural networks (thank you Codecademy). I am also using Qiskit to learn quantum computation (Qiskit has great youtube playlists). I am also currently learning HTML and exploring the world of web design. Feel free to connect with me—I’d love to discuss how we can build the future together.
